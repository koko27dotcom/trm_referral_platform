Each job posting shows a **Referral Bonus** amount. This is what you can earn:

| You Refer | Submit candidate details | - |
| Company Reviews | Company evaluates candidate | - |
| Candidate Hired | Candidate accepts job offer | **85% of bonus** |
| Platform Fee | TRM commission | 15% of bonus |

**Example**: If a job has a 200,000 MMK referral bonus:
- You earn: 170,000 MMK (85%)
- Platform fee: 30,000 MMK (15%)

### Referral Status Meanings
